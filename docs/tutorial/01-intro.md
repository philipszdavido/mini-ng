# Tutorial — Part 1: Introduction

This tutorial mirrors Angular's Tour-of-Heroes style: step-by-step build of a small app using components, templates, DI and routing.

Steps

1. Create an app root component.
2. Create child components.
3. Add simple data binding and events.
4. Add routing and navigation.

Follow the files in `mini-ng-test/src` as a starting point and the `examples.md` for runnable steps.
