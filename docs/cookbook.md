# Cookbook

Quick recipes for common tasks.

- Precompile templates for production: run compiler and bundle with `bundleProject` in `compiler/src/bundle-vite`.
- Hoist constants: keep repeated arrays/styles in component `consts` so the compiler can hoist them.

Examples

- See `mini-ng-test` for small app examples and `docs/examples.md` for run steps.
